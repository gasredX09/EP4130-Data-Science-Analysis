# EP4130-Data-Science-Analysis
This repository all the codes and outputs generated as part of the course (EP4130 - Data Science Analysis) project.

## What is this repository for?
This is a program for solving the statistical On-Off problem.

This program calculates the Bayes factor("B_01"), the Bayesian z-value("S_B_01"), PDF("P_lambda"), CDF("C_lambda"), together with interesting points on the PDF, such as 99% credible UL ("l_99") and the 16% and 84% credible UL for calculating the central interval containing 68% signal posterior probability (for signal error estimation)

## All methods are based on:
